# ColumbiaSHAPECode
A repository for the projects that me and Monica Shi created during our SHAPE summer program at Columbia University.
We took the Advanced Coding and Algorithms class under Professor Daniel Bauer for 3 weeks during the summer.

The OthelloAI is an AI player for the game Othello (also known as Reversi), utilizing the Minimax algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine optimal moves. It first imports helper functions for gameplay essentials like retrieving possible moves, calculating scores, and simulating moves. A compute_utility function evaluates the board’s state, awarding extra points for occupying advantageous positions, such as the corners. The AI's strategy revolves around the Minimax algorithm, which simulates moves ahead to maximize its score and minimize the opponent's best responses. Specifically, minimax_max_node seeks to maximize the AI’s score, while minimax_min_node evaluates the opponent’s possible moves to minimize the AI’s score. To improve efficiency, the AI also uses Alpha-Beta Pruning, which optimizes Minimax by "pruning" branches of the decision tree that cannot affect the final decision, thus reducing the number of nodes evaluated and speeding up the process. This pruned version is implemented in alphabeta_max_node and alphabeta_min_node, and select_move_alphabeta leverages these functions for faster move selection. The main function, run_ai, manages the game loop by interacting with the game manager to receive board updates, compute the best move, and output it.
